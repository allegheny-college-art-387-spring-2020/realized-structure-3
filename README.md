# ART 387: Impossible Architecture - (un)Realized Structure 3

* Point value: 100 pts.
* Due: 8 April 2020, 11:59 PM.

## Ce n'est pas a box

What you have received is a box. But what you will make _is not a box_ and _cannot be a box_. However, your structure should contemplate the idea of gesturing toward what a box is and, as one of us commented during our first critical session, what the "full potential" of a box might be.
Your object must be made out of the box (and _only the box_), but must gesture toward it once was. Other "textures" that one might layer into this assignment include shipment, isolation, (dis)connectedness, or the nature of the parcel post. Some of these we’ve seen in other students' work already. Take the lessons we’ve learned so far and apply them.

We are interested in thinking about the idea of "deconstruction," which is not about taking something apart. As _The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism_ explains it:

> language is...nothing but differences. That is, words have meaning only because of contrast-effects with other words. "Red" means what it does only by contrast with "blue", "green", etc.
  
As we read, think about "deconstruction" (as Stein would have it) as a "system of pointing" to whatever the object up for discussion is _not_.

## Guidelines

### Material Budget

* You must use only a cardboard box.

### Design

- [ ] There are no minimum or maximum dimensions for this structure, though you are constrained by the amount of material contained within your box.

### Writing

- [ ] A label containing:
    * title of the structure
    * measurement of physical area taken up by the structure
    * materials used
    * your name
    
### Documentation

- [ ] A 150-250 word statement describing this project as a manifestation of deconstruction (use our readings!)
  * Place this writing in the `writing` directory
- [ ] At least three (3) photos of the work uploaded to the `studies` directory.

#### Nota bene

Keep in mind that all documentation (including, but not limited to the label) is potentially a part of the finished product. While not part of this project's evaluation, think of these materials as an opportunity to create an architectural design identity.

### Submitting the assignment

#### Final realized structure

* Materials must be turned in using the GitHub repository under which this project was assigned.
* Pictures must be placed in the `studies` directory of the repository

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] Completeness, taken to mean:
  * A structure is completed using the guidelines provided
- [ ] Insightful use writing to inform the design/viewer
- [ ] Documentation of process
